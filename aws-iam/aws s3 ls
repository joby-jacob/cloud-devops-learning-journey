Output showed no error. This confirms:
- Authentication worked
- Role credentials were used automatically
- No access keys stored on the instance

## Key Understanding

| Feature | Access Keys | IAM Role |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Stored on server | Yes | No |
| Risk of leak | High | Low |
| Rotation | Manual | Automatic |
| Best practice | Not recommended | Recommended |

### Why IAM Roles are Better
IAM roles provide temporary, automatically rotating credentials. Nothing is stored on the server, so there is nothing to leak. This makes them more secure than long-term access keys.

## Conclusion
EC2 successfully accessed S3 using IAM Role permissions without configuring access keys. This is the standard method used in real Cloud and DevOps environments.
